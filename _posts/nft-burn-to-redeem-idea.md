Hey everyone 👋 Got a cool (maybe crazy?🤪) NFT idea I wanted to share from the playground.

## The Big Idea: Burn = SOL Back 🔥💰

Picture this: An NFT collection where every time someone trades an NFT, a slice of the royalty $$ goes into one big community **SOL Pool** managed by code (a smart contract).

Now, the fun part: If you own one of these NFTs, you can **BURN** it whenever you want. Poof 🔥

When you burn it, the smart contract looks at two things:
1. How much SOL is in the pool right now? 💰
2. How many NFTs from the collection are *still left* (not burned)? 🤔

Then, it calculates your share: `(Total SOL in Pool) / (NFTs Still Left)` and sends it to your wallet. Like sharing a pizza - the amount of pizza (SOL) divided by the number of people left (NFTs) gives you your slice size 🍕.

## Quick Example 🧮

* Early days: Pool has **1,000 SOL**. All **10,000 NFTs** exist. Burn now? You get `1000 / 10000 = 0.1 SOL`. Nice. 👍
* Later on: Pool has **10,000 SOL** (more trading). 5,000 NFTs have been burned, only **5,000 NFTs** left. Burn now? You get `10000 / 5000 = 2 SOL`. Much nicer 🎉.

## Why Tho? 🤔💎🙌

The payout per burn could go UP over time if:
* More people trade the NFT (adding royalties to the pool 📈).
* More people burn their NFTs (reducing the number left to share the pool 📉).

This might make people want to hold on longer (diamond hands 💎🙌) hoping for a bigger payout later. It also makes the NFTs scarcer, which *could* push up the floor price 🚀.

## Good Things 👍 & Tricky Parts 👎

**Potential Pros:**
* Rewards holders directly from trading activity 💸.
* Reduces supply over time (deflationary 🔥).
* Cool, unique experiment in NFT value ✨.
* Gives holders another way out besides selling ✅.

**Potential Cons / Challenges:**
* Getting royalties *automatically* into the contract's pool is tricky. Manual deposits might be needed first 😬.
* How does the contract *know* exactly how many NFTs are left? Needs careful tracking 🔢.
* What if trading is slow and the pool doesn't grow much? Pool stays small = small slices 📉.
* Game theory. When's the best time to burn? Early bird or last one standing 🤔.

## Just an Idea 💡

Remember, this is just a fun concept brewing in the `smoothbrain.xyz` playground. Building it would involve smart contracts (Anchor time!) and connecting it to this website.
