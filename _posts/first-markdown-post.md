## Writing in Markdown

This feels much more natural for writing blog posts. Now I can just type!

Markdown lets me easily create:

* Lists (like this one)
* **Bold text**
* *Italic text*
* [Links](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
* And even code blocks:

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello from Markdown!");
}
greet();
